      <h3>Abigail's Website Design and Services</h3>
      <hr>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is Abigail DeVries. I am so glad that you are here! I am a website designer and developer stationed 
          in New Jersey. Technology was a skill that I excelled at in my family growing up. But I was also creative and 
          passionate about making things, from fine art to digital designs. So, to utilize both of my talents, I decided 
          to try Web design - and I love it. I can design for all your website needs, from the coding to creating the visuals. 
          I have also majored in graphic design as understanding web design's visual and technical side was essential, and the 
          process inspired me to this fantastic career. I have about two years of field experience and continue improving my skills 
          with new projects. Here is a list of skill sets:
          <ul>
            <li>Graphic Design</li>
            <li>Adobe Software</li>
            <li>Coding -HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
            <li>Fine Art</li>
          </ul>
          Please consider me for your next project! I cannot wait to hear from you!
          <br/>
