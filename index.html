        <p>My name is Abigail DeVries! I am a web designer stationed here in New Jersey.
          Ever since I was young, technology was a skill that I excelled at. But I also 
          loved creativity and using my art and designs skills to create things. Web design 
          gave me the perfect opportunity to do both! I can design for all your website's 
          needs, from the visuals to the coding, as I have experience with graphic design.
          My experience with web design started about a year ago. However, I am eager to 
          learn new things and am still working on new projects to improve. I hope that you 
          will consider me, and I cannot wait to start working with you!
